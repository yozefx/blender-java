The first wiki page for Blender Java

# Introduction #

> This is the first stage of a Java port of Blender3D. The purpose of the code at this stage is simply to recreate the functionality of Blender. For ease of initial porting, updating, syncing, and debugging, the code remains as close to the original C code as possible for now. That means that if you are used to nice looking Java code, then you will probably not be happy with this version. Once a good portion of the code has been ported and is fairly stable then work will begin on making the code more object oriented, modularized and following Java naming conventions and structure (the fun part ... see my other ports for just how different the code can be from the original.)

> To build and run this code you will need JOGL 2.0 (from jogamp.org) for your machine and OS and also the Jython jar (from jython.org.)

> You can use the java\_blender\_dna application to experiment with new auto-generated dna files for Java Blender or your own projects.

Thanks, and let me know your feedback.
